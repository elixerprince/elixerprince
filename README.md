I am a passionate Fullstack Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. A versatile developer specializing in **MERN, Android Development, and Chatbot Development** with a passion for continuous learning. My expertise lies in integration, improving user interfaces, and enhancing overall user experiences. I thrive on solving challenging problems and creating innovative solutions.
I’m interested in digital art, piano music, and webtoons. I'm currently working on a novel called Beyond Reality - An Artist's Perspective which I hope to publish soon.
# Programming Experience
I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hope to get proficient enough in them to create whatever projects I like.
I’m open to collaborating on various projects that allow me to become a more experienced programmer, such as websites, apps, and maybe games in the future.

Pronouns: He/Him
