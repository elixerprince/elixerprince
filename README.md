<h1>Introduction</h1>
Hi, I’m Daniel Leith and I also go by Elixer Prince
# Hobbies
I’m interested in digital art, piano music, and webtoons. I'm currently working on a novel called Beyond Reality - An Artist's Perspective which I hope to publish soon.
# Programming Experience
I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hope to get proficient enough in them to create whatever projects I like.
I’m open to collaborating on various projects that allow me to become a more experienced programmer, such as websites, apps, and maybe games in the future.

Pronouns: He/Him

Fun fact: I hate cucumbers but love banana smoothies and cake.
