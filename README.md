# Introduction
Hi, I’m Daniel Leith (Elixer Prince) and I'm a dedicated front-end developer dedicated to creating stunning websites/applications that solve real-world problems.
# Programming Experience
I’m skilled at:
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript
- I also have experience using front-end frameworks such as TailwindCSS and React.
# Hobbies
I’m interested in digital art, anime piano music, and Webtoons. I'm currently working on a novel called Beyond Reality - An Artist's Perspective which I hope to publish soon.

I’m open to collaborating on various projects that allow me to become a more experienced programmer, such as websites, apps, and maybe games in the future.
